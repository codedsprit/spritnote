Hii, I'm [codedsprit](https://github.com/codedsprit). I am a 17 old guy from Nepal, who loves computers and softwares. 

I'm a Security Researcher(not by profession), I play ctfs and do [Bug Bounty](https://hackerone.com/codedsprit). I believe in secure software and FOSS. Here you can find most of my writeups related to [CTFs'](https://ctf.hackthebox.com/user/profile/369283) and my findings.
